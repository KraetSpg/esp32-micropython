# Basic Examples

## Native Modules

MicroPython unterstÃ¼tzt `native modules`.

> This section describes how to build and work with .mpy files that contain native machine code from a language other than Python. This allows you to write code in a language like C, compile and link it into a .mpy file, and then import this file like a normal Python module. This can be used for implementing functionality which is performance critical, or for including an existing library written in another language.
